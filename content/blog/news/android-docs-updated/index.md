### Android Docs have Been Updated!

Hey Everyone!

Our mesh network has been growing stronger and smarter every single day — even faster than the updates hitting the website. A huge thank you to all of you who’ve been pitching in, building, testing, and expanding the mesh. Your contributions are what make this community thrive.  

We’ve also got some fresh news to share: one of our community members (and a contributor to the Meshtastic project) let us know that the Android Application docs have officially been updated and approved.  

This is a perfect chance to dive in, explore the latest features, and make sure you’re getting the most out of your setup:

Thanks again to everyone helping push the mesh forward — let’s keep the momentum rolling.
