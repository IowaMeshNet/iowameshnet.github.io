## Welcome to IowaMesh.net

I wanted to take a moment and say welcome to anybody whos joining us here a IowaMesh! What started out as a simple Meshmap, MQTT hosted server and connecting a group of folks from Iowa Radio Operators has evolved into what you see here today. I can't thank Ethan (@nv1k) for helping get the frame of this built and putting up with my 1000 stupid questions (I wasn't a developer first; Network Engineer turned PreSales Enginneer). What you see here is hours effort making sure we can best serve the Iowa and potentially further. 

We'll start posting up blog posts with builds and hardware lists. Also have pages for other hardware recomendations and some setup guides for the beginner through the more advanced user. Bear with us as we continue to build out that material (and if you have recomendations send us a note!). Not that this is any bit of an excuse, but this isn't our day job so we will be working on this as we can. But know that we are dedicated to keep this alive and well!

So whats next? We aren't sure. We want to build out a backbone across Iowa that users within the State and those traveling through can utilize with Meshtastic. Either way we want to connect with you and your use case and learn more. How could we be a resource to your club or maybe individual effort.

Find us on Discord, Email us with ideas, Find the source on GitHub and We are looking forward to getting to know everyone!
