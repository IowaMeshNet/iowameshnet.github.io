## WisMesh Pocket First Impressions


The WisMesh Pocket from RAKWireless is a great place to get started in the world of Meshtastic. Its robust design, long battery life, and ease of use make it the perfect first node for anyone, beginner or experienced radio operator. The unit has a high-quality screen, well-printed case, an independent on/off switch, and GPS receiver preinstalled.

### Initial impressions

I’ve had this device for three days so far. It arrived ready to go out of the box. The battery had 80% charge (your mileage may vary), and I have yet to charge it. At the time of writing, it is at 67% with intermittent GPS usage. You will have to update the firmware, as updates have been released since these were produced, but that is expected.

### Functionality

Overall, the unit is very easy to use and understand. The screen is a good size, making reading off it easy, and has a good brightness. The unit isn’t too big, but not too small. It fits in jeans pockets comfortably if walking or working, and has a loop on the top of the case for a keychain or string. The included antenna leaves a bit to be desired, and I am considering upgrading mine. 

### Setup

One of the shining features of the WisMesh Pocket is that it’s ready to go out of the box. The unit ships pre-assembled with Meshtastic on it. All you have to do is connect your phone via the Meshtastic app, set your region, and away you go!

### Final Thoughts

Overall, the WisMesh Pocket is a well-built unit that’s simple to use and understand. It is on the higher end of the Meshtastic Budget range, coming in at $99 at the time of writing, but you absolutely get what you pay for
