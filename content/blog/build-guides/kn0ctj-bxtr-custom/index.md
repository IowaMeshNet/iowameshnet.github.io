## The Last of the Custom Builds (Famous Last Words)

When I first started with Meshtastic I was grabbing random devices and parts.  After finding what worked out well for the  types of nodes deployed I have a surplus of parts that I've slowly been putting together to get some actual use out of it. I'm finally down to the last of the random parts (Until I get some wild thought and buy more random)

I won't go into the grave details of building this, but will leave you with the parts list! Given this was pretty custom building it could take many forms

Assembly can be up to you, but I opted to lay out the box like this:

I did cut off the connector from the solar panel and soldered in the RAK Solar Connectors to put on the board. Also used some solid double sided tape to make sure the wires were not moving around the case.

With the solar panel added in and plumbed through the front of the case. Touch it up with a little bit of silicon to seal up the holes and were able to deploy this!

We are hoping to get a few more Infrastructure Nodes out there now that the weather is nice. If you have a place where one might make sense reach out to us as we would like to connect with people to continue building out IowaMesh!
