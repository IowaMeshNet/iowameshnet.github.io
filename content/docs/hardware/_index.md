There are tons of options for hardware when it comes to Meshtastic. From prebuilt setups for the beginners all the way to DIY setups for custom deployments in cars, routers or base stations. We’ll try our best to account for as many levels of users that visit the site and want to get into Meshtastic. 

For the user who wants to just get involved or not wanting to assemble anything there are some easy solutions to invest in.
Heltec ESP32 V3 [Heltec V3 Node Kit](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v3/) comes with a case already that takes minimal assembly and an easy barrier to entry with a low cost to get started. The ESP versions are good but given that it’s based on ESP32 battery life becomes the concern. The ESP modules tend to use the battery quicker than a something based on NRF style chip. The base option here doesn’t not have GPS and would need to be added separately. Since it doesn’t have the GPIO headers it would require customer work. Here is another good option for an Heltec v3 providing you all the hardware you need to get started: [Pacific North Heltec Kit ](https://pacificnorthwest3d.com/products/nomad)

The T114 kit from Muzi Works [Muzi Works T114 Kit](https://muzi.works/products/h2t-complete-device-heltec-t114-with-gps-running-meshtastic) is another option for low entry into Meshtastic. While it is a little more in price you are getting a complete kit including the T114, Battery, GPS Module, Antenna and case. The T114 is based on the NRF processors which are super-efficient on battery life. 

Another great NRF build is from Rokland. They have released their WisMesh Pocket [Rokland WishMesh Pocket](https://store.rokland.com/products/wismesh-pocket) which is a small version of the Rak Wireless board, screen, battery, GPS Module. Given that this is based on an NRF module you can expect to get great battery life out of it as well as functionality with the screen.

Check back as we will add new options as they come out. Check out the blog posts as well for options that will have some 3d printing involved, but still low cost to entry.
