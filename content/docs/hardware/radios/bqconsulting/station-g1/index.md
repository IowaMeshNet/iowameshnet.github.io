### Station G1
Intro:
The Station G1 is part of the Station Edition series designed by B&Q Consulting for Meshtastic. It’s a compact, rugged LoRa device built for high‑performance communication, making it ideal as a backbone node in mesh networks.

Key Features:
- ESP32 MCU with Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth support
- Semtech SX1262 LoRa transceiver
- High‑power PA (up to 35 dBm TX power @ 915/868 MHz)
- Rugged SMA antenna socket for reliable external antenna use
- Wide input voltage range (8VDC–20VDC) for flexible power options
- Rich external I/O interfaces for expansion and integration
- Compact, durable design suitable for fixed installations

Considerations:
- Not portable — designed for permanent or semi‑permanent backbone nodes
- Requires stable power supply (DC input or regulated external source)
- Higher cost compared to entry‑level boards like Heltec or T‑Beam
- Best suited for club field stations, town coverage, or contest backbone deployment
