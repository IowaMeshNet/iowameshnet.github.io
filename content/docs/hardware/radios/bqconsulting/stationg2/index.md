### Station G2
Intro:
The Station G2 is a stable, higher-power node designed for fixed installations, forming the backbone of a mesh network.

Key Features:
- Nordic nRF52840 MCU with SX1262 LoRa
- Larger form factor for better heat dissipation
- Stable power options (USB or external supply)
- Designed for continuous operation

Considerations:
- Not portable — intended for fixed sites
- Requires reliable power source
- Best for backbone coverage in towns, club fields, or permanent mesh deployment
