### Heltec MeshPocket
Intro:
The MeshPocket is Heltec’s newest Meshtastic device, blending a daily‑use power bank with integrated LoRa communication. It’s built around the Nordic nRF52840 MCU and SX1262 transceiver, with a sleek design that makes it easy to carry while still serving as a reliable mesh node.

Key Features:
- MCU: Nordic nRF52840 with Bluetooth 5.0
- LoRa Transceiver: Semtech SX1262
- Frequency Options: 863–870 MHz or 902–928 MHz
- Display: 2.13″ e‑ink screen for low‑power status updates
- Battery: 5000 mAh or 10000 mAh options
- Charging: Qi2 magnetic wireless charging + USB‑C
- Connectors: Magnetic pogo pin cable for firmware flashing
- Form Factor: Pocket‑sized, designed for daily carry and outdoor use

Considerations:
- Firmware flashing requires the magnetic pogo pin cable (not standard USB).
- No physical buttons for messaging — interaction is limited to display and app pairing.
- Best suited for activators or everyday users who want a dual‑purpose device (power bank + mesh node).
- Battery life is excellent, but the larger 10,000 mAh version adds bulk.
- Ideal for off‑grid scenarios like contests, outdoor exploration, or emergency communication.
