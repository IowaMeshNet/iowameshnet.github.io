### Seeed Studio SenseCAP Solar
Intro:
The SenseCAP Solar is a rugged, outdoor‑ready Meshtastic‑compatible node from Seeed Studio. It’s designed for long‑term deployments with integrated solar charging, weather resistance, and reliable LoRa communication. This makes it ideal for backbone nodes in wide‑area mesh networks like Iowa Mesh.

Key Features:
- MCU: Nordic nRF52840 with Bluetooth 5.0 support
- LoRa Transceiver: Semtech SX1262
- Frequency Options: 863–870 MHz or 902–928 MHz
- Power System:
- Integrated solar panel for continuous outdoor operation
- Built‑in rechargeable lithium battery
- USB‑C port for backup charging
- Enclosure: IP65‑rated weatherproof housing for outdoor use
- Antenna: External SMA connector for high‑gain antennas
- Deployment: Designed for pole or wall mounting in outdoor environments

Considerations:
- Higher upfront cost compared to entry‑level boards (Heltec V3, T‑Beam)
- Larger physical footprint due to solar panel and rugged enclosure
- Best suited for permanent outdoor backbone nodes rather than portable activations
- Requires good solar exposure for reliable long‑term operation
- Ideal for park deployments, club field stations, or rural coverage where power reliability is critical
