Series Â½-wave center-fed dipole antennas are designed for outdoor and indoor use. They deliver outstanding performance in a rugged and cosmetically attractive package. The antenna contains a helical element and internal counterpoise which eliminates external ground plane dependence and maximizes performance.

It's great low cost option for starting out. Does not require a ground plane.
